"""Concurrency and idempotency control for Agent invocations.

Encapsulates the per-Agent state that guards against concurrent invocations and
deduplicates retried requests via caller-supplied idempotency tokens. Designed to
be used by ``Agent.stream_async`` as a single delegate, keeping the orchestration
in ``agent.py`` and the synchronization primitives + bookkeeping here.
